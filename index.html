                        <textarea autofocus>Hey! &#10;I know there are a lot of questions in your mind, like what's happening, who are you, when did this happen?&#10; &#10; So, I created this website just to express my feelings because it's so difficult to find you and tell you everything. Either you are in QC or with Anulipi, and hn Anulipi ko bolna, please don't mind ðŸ˜‚ because obviously, you both are best friends, so you'll always be together. And the second reason is me, because it's so difficult for me to tell you everything. I know you don't know me but fir bhi Will you be my valentine? &#10; If you want to take some time or days, please take your time. If you want to first talk to me and get to know me that is also perfectly fine. &#10;&#10; Okay Byee ðŸ˜Š and Happy Valentine's Day ðŸ’–</textarea>
